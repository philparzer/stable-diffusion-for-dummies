## 0. Prerequisites üéí

What you'll need:

- [x] Windows 10 or 11
- [x] decent NVIDIA graphics card (about 4 VRAM and more)

On an Apple Silicon Mac?

## 1. Downloads ‚¨áÔ∏è

Let's download some stuff.

### 1.1 CUDA

<a href="https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-11-6-2-download-archive?target_os=Windows&target_arch=x86_64" rel="noopener noreferrer">Download and install CUDA drivers
</a>

### 1.2 Anaconda

<a href="https://www.anaconda.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer">Download and install Anaconda</a>

### 1.3 Visual Studio Code

<a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/Download" rel="noopener noreferrer">Download and install Visual Studio Code</a>

### 1.4 This Repo

- Download **this repo** as .zip
- unzip it in an appropriate location (preferably on a SSD)

### 1.5 Stable Diffusion Weights

- <a href="https://huggingface.co/CompVis/stable-diffusion-v-1-4-original" rel="noopener noreferrer">Download the model weights from Huggingface</a> (you'll need to create an account)
- unzip the file
- move it into the folder you've downloaded before ```stable-diffusion-for-dummies/models/ldm/stable-diffusion-v1```
- rename the file to *model.ckpt*

TODO GIF

## 2. Setup üõ†Ô∏è

- use Windows Search to search for 'Anaconda' and open 'Anaconda Prompt'
- in Anaconda Prompt type the following:

``` command prompt
conda env create -f environment.yaml
conda activate ldm
```

- in Visual Studio Code, navigate to the folder ```stable-diffusion-for-dummies/```

- this could take a while, go grab a cup of coffee ‚òï

## 3. Usage üñºÔ∏è

We're all set, let's generate some images. We've implemented several different ways to use Stable Diffusion. But first let's talk about configuration.

### 3.1 Configuration

In the root folder ```stable-diffusion-for-dummies/``` you should see ```config.ini```. This file contains several fields you are free to update.

| config.ini fields | description |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| image_height = 512  | height of the generated image, in pixels  |
| image_width = 512  | width of the generated image, in pixels  |
| number_of_iterations = 1  |  number of times the generation process is going to run  |
| number_of_images_per_iteration* = 2  | how many images are generated each time the generation process runs |
| seed | TODO  |

> *If your number_of_iterations (batch_size) is too big, you could run into problems. I'd suggest starting out small (at like < 5) and increasing it in small steps to find out how many images your graphics card can handle.

### 3.2 Usage Basics

There is one important distinction other than user experience when it comes to the ways of using this repo described below:

- txt-2-img (text to image) -> generates an image based on a given prompt
- img-2-img (image to image) -> generates a new image based on a given image and a prompt
- animation -> generates a number of frames based on a given image and prompt

Before using any of the methods listed below, make sure to open Visual Studio Code with Anaconda:

Then, open a command prompt in Visual Studio Code and enter this command:

``` command prompt
conda activate ldm
```

### 3.2 Use the graphical user interface (GUI)

The most straight-forward, albeit not the fastest, way of using this repository for image generation is to enter the command below and pick one of two choices. This opens up a graphical user interface that you might feel more comfortable working with starting out.

```command prompt
python gui.py 
```

TODO GIF

Find all generated images in the folder ```/outputs/txt2img-samples/<your-prompt>```.
Or ```/outputs/img2img-samples/<your-prompt>``` if you chose img2img.

### 3.3 Use the console

We recommended using the CLI (Command Line Interface) as soon as you feel more comfortable.
There are several commands to use that all serve a different purpose. Enter one of the commands below and the CLI will guide you through the whole process, just make sure to read the console output.

The first two commands are fairly straightforward and handle txt2img and img2img generation.

```command prompt
python txt2img.py
```

```command prompt
python img2img.py 
```

Find all generated images in the folder ```/outputs/txt2img-samples/<your-prompt>```.
Or ```/outputs/img2img-samples/<your-prompt>``` if you chose img2img.

---

The next two commands allow the program to go through a list of prompts that were set by you in ```prompt_list.txt``` beforehand.

TODO GIF

```command prompt
python txt2img_prompt_queue.py 
```

```command prompt
python img2img_prompt_queue.py 
```

Find all generated images in the folder ```/outputs/txt2img-samples/<your-prompt>```.
Or ```/outputs/img2img-samples/<your-prompt>``` if you chose img2img.

---

<p id ="animation.py">The last command is a special addition that allows you to generate an animation based on a given image and prompt.</p>

```command prompt
python animation.py 
```

TODO GIF

Find all generated frames in the folder ```/outputs/animation-samples/<your-prompt>```.
We recommend using <a href="https://ezgif.com/maker" rel="noopener noreferrer">EZGIF</a> to generate the animation. Just upload all frames, hit generate and edit the animation to your liking.
